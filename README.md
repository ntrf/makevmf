# makevmf

Tool to transform Q3 `.map` files into HL2 `.vmf` files.

Currently support is limited to brushes only and textures are not preserved. Also only static world is converted. Any entities are lost in the process.

Future versions will include support for:

* Textures
* Patches as displacements
* Entities
